# Megan's SQL Portfolio

## Welcome to My SQL Portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written. Feel free to take a look around and reach out if you have any questions!

*This repository is a collection of my SQL projects as I learn and grow on my journey to becoming a data analyst. You'll find examples of how I query, clean, and analyze data using real-world scenarios and public datasets.

I'm focusing on building a strong foundation in:

âœ… Writing clean and readable queries
âœ… Using JOIN, GROUP BY, WHERE, and HAVING effectively
âœ… Exploring window functions and subqueries
âœ… Solving business-style problems using SQL

I believe that data tells powerful stories â€” and I'm learning how to ask the right questions and let the data speak.

If you have any questions, feedback, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out. I'd love to chat!

Thanks for stopping by ðŸ˜Š
â€” Megan
